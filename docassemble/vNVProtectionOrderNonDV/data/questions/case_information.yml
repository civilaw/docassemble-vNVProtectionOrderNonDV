  <p> The purpose of a protection order is to keep a person away from you for safety reasons. It can order a person to stay away from your home, work, school, or other places you visit regularly. A temporary protection order (“TPO”) may be issued for up to 45 days without notifying the other party first. You can also request an extended protection order that could last up to 2 years.<p> 
  <p> There is no fee to file for a protection order.<p>
