# Nevada Self-Help Package
A protection order is a court order that requires someone to stay away from you and any locations you identify (such as work, home, etc.).</br>
A "temporary protection order" (a "TPO") may be issued for up to 45 days without notifying the other party first. You must fill out an application, and the judge might want you to come to a hearing if the judge has questions. If approved, the Sheriff will serve the other person with the TPO if you provide a valid local address for them.</br>
You can also request an "extended protection order." This can be included with your original application, or you can request it later as long as your TPO is in effect. You and the other person will have to go to a hearing where the judge can ask both of you questions before deciding whether to extend the order. The protection order can be extended for up to two years.</br>
There is no fee to file your application.</br>
You may want to talk to a domestic violence advocate first about your options. An advocate can help you think about a safety plan so you are prepared before, during, and after a protection order is in place. You can contact the following hotlines to get free information if you are not sure what to do:</br>
